### **Road Accident Analysis – Description** 🚗⚠️  

This project analyzes road accident data to identify **high-risk areas, peak accident times, and key contributing factors** such as road type, weather conditions, and junction types. The insights derived from this analysis are used to propose **data-driven recommendations** to reduce accidents and enhance road safety.  

#### **Key Findings:**  
- **Total Accidents:** 301K  
- **Total Casualties:** 409K  
- **Peak Accident Hours:** 4 PM - 8 PM (Highest risk period)  
- **Most Affected Cities:** Birmingham, Leeds, Bradford  
- **Most Dangerous Road Type:** Single Carriageway (78% of accidents)  
- **Weather Impact:** Majority of accidents occurred in **clear weather** (243K), suggesting speeding is a major factor.  

#### **Recommendations for Safer Roads:**  
✅ Implement **AI-based traffic monitoring** for high-risk areas  
✅ Enforce **stricter speed limits**, especially in peak hours  
✅ Improve **road infrastructure** (better lighting, pedestrian safety, lane discipline)  
✅ Conduct **city-specific accident prevention campaigns**  

#### **Tools & Technologies Used:**  
- **Power BI** for interactive data visualization 📊  
- **Excel & VBA** for automation and analysis 📑  
- **Python (if applicable)** for data cleaning & preprocessing 🐍  

This project provides **actionable insights for government agencies, traffic management authorities, and urban planners** to **minimize road accidents and enhance safety for all road users.** 🚦
